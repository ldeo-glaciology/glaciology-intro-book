# Phase and Frequency

**(under construction)**

Purpose of this page:

* explain the relationship between phase, frequency and angular frequency


This is an equation relating phase and angular frequency:

$$
\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \omega_c,
$$

where $t$ is time [s], $\phi$ is the phase of a radio wave [rad], $\omega$ is the angular frequency [rad s$^{-1}$]
