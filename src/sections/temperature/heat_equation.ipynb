    "# Heat equation\n",
    "Heat flow, and the corresponding time variation of temperature in ice sheet and glaciers can be described by an advection-diffusion equation, referred to as the heat equation. In cases when melting or freezing is involved is is convenient to instead consider enthalpy (rather than simply heat), but for simiplicity we will initially just consider cases when the ice or snow is below the melting point, so the simpler heat equation is equivelent to an enthalpy formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we derive the heat equation from first principles, allowing for temporal and spatial changes in density and velocity. Allowing for these changes results in the same equation that you would reach if you assumed density and velocity constant and uniform, but considering the most general scenario gives us an opportunity to think about the final equation does not depend on if you include them or not.

    "We consider a three-dimensional space with cooridinates $x$, $y$, and $z$ corresponding respectively to left-right, in and out of the page, and up and down. Glaciologists often use $x$ to refer to the glacier direction paralell to the large-scale flow and $y$ to refer to the across flow direction. We define a small box with side lengths $\\delta x$, $\\delta y$ and $\\delta z$ and volume $V = \\delta x \\delta y \\delta z$ ({numref}`fig:HeatEquationBox`). The box contains firn with a mean temperature $T$ and a mean density $\\rho$. The firn/ice is flowing with a 3-D velocity field defined by the vector field $\\vec{u}$. We ignore the heat content of the air in the pores of the firn and ice. "

    "Fields are quantities that are defined at every point in space or time. The air temperature in a room can be defined as a field, with every location in the volume of the room associated with a single value: the temperature. Because temperature is a *scalar* quantity (it requires only one number to represent it at each point in space or time), this field is called a scalar field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vector quantities like velocity, displacement, or force, can also be represented in fields. The only difference is that at each location in space or time a vector field has multiple values associated with to represent its vector quantity. For example, a velocity field has components of velocity corresponding to each direction in the coordinate system. In the case of our 3-D cartesian coordinate system, this means that at each point in space and time the velocity field has separate values representing the component of the velocity in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions. We will denote these separate components using the glaciological convension of $u$, $v$, and $w$ respectively, and we  write $\\vec{u} = (u, v, w)$. It can be a little confusing that the vector field and its x-component are both represented by u's, but the arrow over the vector field symbol distinguishes it from the x-component of velocity.  \n",

    "Advection is the transport of heat due to the flowing ice. For example, if the ice upstream of a given location is warmer, ice flow will move this warmer ice into the location in question and contribute to increasing the temperature. Based just on this intuitive picture of advection, you can guess that the rate at which the temperature changes due to this process is proportional to the velocity of the ice and the rate at which $T$ increases in an upstream direction. The derivation below proves this intuition correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion is the change in heat content in the box due to spatial variation in conduction. Heat flows from warm areas to cold areas through conduction, at a rate proportoinal to the temperature gradient. So, if the temperature gradient is different in different places, mismatches in the rate of heat conduction leads to areas warming up and cooling down. As we are interested in spatial variations in the temperature gradient, you might guess that the 'gradient of the gradient of' the temperature will end up being important. This is called the 'second-derivative' or ' curvature' of the temperature, and does indeed appear in our final expression."

Instead we use a trick, which we use in multiple places in this chapters and others, and say that on the right wall these variables take a value that is equal to their values on the left wall plus a small change which depends on their gradient in the $x$ direction.

    "Consider a location with a local minimum in $T$ ({numref}`fig:T_minimum`). Immediately to the left of this location $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} < 0$. Immediately to the right, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} > 0$  -  $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$ is increasing with $x$. In other words,  $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} > 0$, so according to {eq}`C_x_net` this process contributes to an increase in heat in this location, reducing the depth of the minima. This makes sense because we are at a minimum in $T$, so in both directions higher $T$ causes heat to be conducted towards this minimum. The same argument applies, not just at minima (or in reverse at maxima) in $T$, but anywhere with curvature in $T$: its all down to the gradient in $T$ being different on side of a given location than it is on the other side, so that the *net* contribution of conduction is to either increase or decrease tempeature.

    "Notice that the volume of the box $V$ has cancelled from both sides of this expression. Let's think about what this cancelling of $V$ really means. $V$ appeared on the left of this expression because it takes more heat to increase the temperature of a larger box than a smaller box. $V$ appeared on the right of this expression because all the heat fluxes into and out of the box for given $T$, $\\vec{u}$ and $\\rho$ fields, are larger for a larger box than a smaller one because the walls are larger. This explains what $V$ cancelling means: It takes more heat to change the temperature of a larger box, but a larger box *gets* more heat from set of conditions. It also makes a lot of sense that $V$ should cancel because the size and shape this box was chosen arbitrarily and for convenience and should not appear in our final result. In fact, the expression above is very close to our final result. However, there is one interesting simplification that remains to be made. "

    "Let's note what happened here: the tern on the right of {eq}`Heat_eq_full_1`, $ c T \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}$, representing the heat density, i.e. how much heat is in each cubic meter, cancelled with the three flux diveregence terms on the right ($c T \\frac{\\partial \\left(u\\rho \\right)}{\\partial x}$ etc.). This shows us that while these divergence terms can change the ammount of heat in the box, they cannot change the temperature because the density in the box changes to counterbalance any change in the heat content. For example, suppose that spatial gradients in flux caused the heat content in the box to double. At the same time, the density in the box would also double, meaning that the ice requires double the heat to maintain the same temperatue as it had before the change. "
